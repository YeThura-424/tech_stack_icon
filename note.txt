to add in readme => generate manifest.js after updating icon , after adding new one


I put together a tiny project to make it effortless 
to grab tech-stack icons — SVGs, direct links, and 
simple embeds so you can add icons to docs and designs 
in seconds. Built this because little quality-of-life 
tools save a lot of time. Tell me which icon you use most! 👇

If you’d like to add new one, edit existing or want to contribute icons, you are more than welcome!
